# FCC Calculator Project Codepen code

## This repo is a fully tested and passing FCC Calculator Project from the FCC FrontEnd Libraries Certification course

This project is not at all responsive and is not designed to be super pretty. However, as of this readme commit, this repo code passes all the FCC automated tests for project submission.
